## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used this challenge to remember how to work on basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Now I remember how to work with this basic elements and create small components. I like to do this kind of challenges because sometimes I'm too used to React and SaaS that when it comes to the basics I don't know what to do, I will say it's too raw that it's difficult to work with.

```css
.general {
  background: url("/images/pattern-background-desktop.svg");
  background-position: top;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to work on the basics and React simultaneously, probably making the same projects but using both stacks )?. I would like to start working with Vue.js too. In matters of this project, I would like to continue working with raw CSS and basic Bootstrap grid.
